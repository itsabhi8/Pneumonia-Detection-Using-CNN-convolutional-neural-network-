# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN-convolutional-neural-network-
Trained a YOLOv9 CNN for pneumonia detection in chest X-rays. Leveraged RSNA pneumonia dataset to train the model for classifying normal vs. pneumonia cases. Achieved promising results using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Project paves the way for AI-powered chest X-ray analysis in resource-constrained settings.
